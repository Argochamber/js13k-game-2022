# Necrerium

The imperium of the dead.

## Theme

The game will spin around administrating your necro-empire, formed by the gods
of the Stigian realm, a dimension where the souls of the damned are pulled in.

You're from a race of soul-gathering gods, that thrive on the lost souls. You
can use the resources of the dead ones to build and expand your empire.

### The main resource

The coin of this realm is the **soul**, human souls to be exact. This is the
main resource that serves as a currency and an energy and power measure.
